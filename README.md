# Energy_Consumption_Prediction
Predicting the energy consumption (kWh) in a steel production
This is a small project done to compare (5) different machine learning models.
The models were built and used in predicting the energy consumption in kWh in a steel production using the steel industry energy consumption dataset from the UCI resipository.
The data can be obtained from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Steel+Industry+Energy+Consumption+Dataset.
